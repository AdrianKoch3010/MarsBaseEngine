@section welcome Welcome
Welcome to the documentation of the Mars Base Engine. Here you'll find a detailed reference for all classes, functions, variables and macros etc. that are part of the public API.
If you are looking for examples or a more general explanation of the engine's main features, you might want to have a look at the <a href="https://adriankoch3010.github.io/MarsBaseEngine/">tutorials</a> provided on the GitHub page.

All functions, constants, namespaces, classes and other types which are part of the public API are located inside the namespace
@b mbe (or one of the few nested namespaces). Everything inside namespace @b detail exist only for internal implementation.
Don't use them.
